# Project Description

Jean Mobile Beauty and Wellness is a personal care services organization operating in and around the Johannesburg Metropolitan City. The company offers mobile services, taking their business to the client, and providing the required service at a location of the chosen by the client. They offer beauty and wellness services which leans them towards female customers than males. 

This services include but are not limited to, skin therapy, massages, waxing and manicures and pedicures, all of which provided as a mobile service. The business provides a google business listing and Facebook page from which potential customers can get in touch with the business and further enquire about their services.
The organization does not currently have a website or application from which they can direct their customers to. We will undertake the task of creating a web application that will not only help Jeanâ€™s Mobile Beauty and Wellness increase their online presence but to also take advantage of the unique service that they offer to their customers.

We will develop a web application that helps the company in advertising their business, giving them information on their services and most importantly of offering those services to the customers through the internet. Potential customers will be able to browse services catalogue, enquire further and eventually make an appointment for the services; including paying for them over the internet, allowing Jean to only focus on delivering the best services to them.
