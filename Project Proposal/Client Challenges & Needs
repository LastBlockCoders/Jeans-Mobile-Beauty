Identified challenges with current operations

•	Jean’s Mobile Beauty and Wellness does not currently have a website or application from which they can direct their customers to even though it relies on an e-commerce business model.
•	The business mostly relies on word-of-mouth advertising for their services. This presents a problem in that once a customer hears about the business, they have only a WhatsApp business account to view further information online and this relies on the business owner being able to respond to their enquiries.
•	Due to appointments being made through chats or voice calls, the business is forced with having to accept or deny some services to their clients which may have challenging requests which the business may be unable to fulfil in time.
•	Potential clients have no information on how these mobile services are carried out and what each service will provide; unless they direct their all of their questions to the business owner.
•	Customers also have no way of knowing if and when will they be able to make an appointment without consulting with the business owner first.

Client’s Needs:

•	Offer beauty and wellness services information in way that is appealing to potential customers
•	Get communication or enquiries from clients directed to the business WhatsApp Account
•	Get automatically processed appointments with the flexibility of being able to re-schedule or reject in case of unforeseen challenges
•	Be able to accept bookings a week in advance
•	Receive online payments with some cash options for specific services
